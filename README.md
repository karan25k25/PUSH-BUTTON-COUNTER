##A push-button counter increments a count each time a mechanical button is pressed.

Debouncing—via simple delays, state machines, or shift register filtering—is essential to prevent false counts.

Edge detection ensures one count per physical press.

Implementation can use timer polling or interrupt-driven logic.

System outputs the count to displays (LEDs, LCD, etc.), and can be extended for long presses or multi-click action.
